# Zigbee2Tasmota PCB

This project contains Gerber files for a PCB designed for a Hub running [Zigbee2Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/Zigbee).

If needed or wanted (e.g. for flashing an update) it is possible to flash the CC2530 in two ways:
* using a CCDebugger, there is an interface on pcb for that.
* using the Nodemcu itself to flash the CC2530. You can find how to do this in the link above.
